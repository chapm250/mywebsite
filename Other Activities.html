    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
</div>
<p>

    This was my first actual programming class. I learned what data structures are, how to use them efficiently,
    and how to build them while also learning about object oriented languages (we used Java). My first challenging project was creating a circular doubly linked list.
    A circular doubly linked list is a linked list that starts with a handle node and is connected to two other nodes
    called previous and next. Each of those nodes have a previous and next node next them. This forms a circle, and because it
    is a circle you can traverse the linked list clockwise or counter-clockwise, allowing it to be faster than a conventional
    linked list which can only go to the next node. Other data structures that I practiced with include hash tables, abstract
    classes, AVL trees, heaps. Some examples can be seen here "insert examples from github"
