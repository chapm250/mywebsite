    <h3>Multivariate Statistics</h3>
</div>
<p>
    This was my first high level statistics class. I learned how to become proficient in R, and learned how to make
    interactive graphs with ShinyR. Throughout the class we used multivariate statistical analysis tools such as Principal
    Component Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, Cluster Analysis, Classification and Regression
    Trees, and Path Analysis to analyze Minnesota County health data.

    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
</div>
<p>
    Data Analysis went more in depth in how to interpret, test, and transform data to make the best model possible. I learned
    many tools, too many to make a list so I have created an HTML file using Knitr to show you an example. The data was
    from the Australian Institute of Sport, and I created a model to predict body fat from height, weight and red cell count.
    I also predicted the difference in body fat percentage between male and female basketball players.
