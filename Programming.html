    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
</div>
<p>

    This was my first actual programming class. I learned what data structures are, how to use them efficiently,
    and how to build them while also learning about object oriented languages (we used Java). My first challenging project was creating a circular doubly linked list.
    A circular doubly linked list is a linked list that starts with a handle node and is connected to two other nodes
    called previous and next. Each of those nodes have a previous and next node next them. This forms a circle, and because it
    is a circle you can traverse the linked list clockwise or counter-clockwise, allowing it to be faster than a conventional
    linked list which can only go to the next node. Other data structures that I practiced with include hash tables, abstract
    classes, AVL trees, heaps. Some examples can be seen here "insert examples from github"

    <h3>Software Development</h3>
</div>
<p>

    During this class we learned how to work together creating websites using the agile development process. Some of the
    tools we used were javascript, Node.js, backbone.js. My class was lucky enough that the company LightSide
    decided to let us design the front end and the back end. We designed the backend using backbone as the model for
    Node.js, and the front end using bootstrap. My class did this in small groups, changing the groups every two weeks.
    I was mostly in the group that was working on getting our website to request information from LightSide's API and
    handling the response. It was a very exciting project because we got to work with a real company. We met with them
    every two weeks (each iteration) and consulted with them on what we should do next.

    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
</div>
<p>

    Algorithms was my first challenging theory heavy based course in my journey to learn computer science. In this class I learned
    how to find the best case, worst case, and average case of algorithms. In order to get us to learn more about
    sorting algorithms we had a competition with our class where we were tasked to create a sorting algorithm
    with Java to sort a list integers based on three criteria. My team (there were 18 teams of two people each) placed
    third by using MergeSort, a modified version of  Bucket Sort, and another different modification of Bucket Sort.
    We Also learned about Turing Machines, DFAs, NFAs,and graph theory
</p>

<div class="well well-sm ">
    <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
</div>
<p>
    This was a also a more social theory class into what makes a good UI. We learned the pros and cons of
    using different kinds of UI. from web interfaces, to embedded brain interfaces.
</p>

<div class="well well-sm ">
    <h3>Models of Computing Systems</h3>
</div>
<p>
    Models was an interesting class where we learned a broad amount of things. During my time in this class
    we learned some scripting languages, bash and ruby, how to run Java methods on multiple threads,
    how C works, and how to prevent memory leaks with valgrind. There was also a lot of low level abstract theory that
    we learned, for instance how to handle communication between servers and clients, what to do if a request
    gets dropped, pros and cons of at least once request protocol and only once request protocol.
