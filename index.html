<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</div>

<p class = "lead"> Hello my name is Josh Chapman, not Felix Chapman, sorry if that confused you. NameCheap was nice enough to give me a free .me domain name, although joshchapman.me had been taken so I am using a nickname that I have aka Felix. This is a little project that I thought would be fun and help me explain my experience to future employers (hello!) while allowing me to practice hosting websites, setting up projects in a virtual server environment, working in a cloud envirnment, and some front end fun. I am hosting it through a virtual server with Fedora installed hosted by Digital Ocean and serving it with Express. For my interactive parts of my website (Sign Language Website, and PizzaHub) I am using Node, Express, Angular, and for information storage MariaDB.

    Right now I am finishing up my senior year at the University of Minnesota, Morris and
    currently looking for a full time job. I will be available in June 2016 and looking for a Software Development or Data
    Analysis position. You can click on the programming tab to get more information on my programming experience
	and for data analysis experience click on the data analysis tab. Below is a picture of me from my intership at InfoLink where I am installing some networking equipment on top of the University of Minnesota Morris's watertower
